# Clipboard-Health-Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:

This project was developed as part of a data exercise for Clipboard Health, a nationwide staffing platform that connects healthcare professionals with facilities in need of support. With the U.S. healthcare system facing increasing pressure from staff shortagesâ€”especially among registered nurses (RNs)â€”Clipboard Healthâ€™s Sales team must take a strategic and data-driven approach to identify facilities and regions most likely to need contracted nurses.

To support this, I conducted a detailed analysis using the CMS Payroll Based Journal (PBJ) staffing data and additional CMS datasets, focusing on the most recent quarter available (2024 Q2). I explored staffing indicators such as nursing staff turnover, occupancy rates, deficiency scores, and score gaps across various states, ownership types, and facility categories. The objective was to identify trends, uncover areas with potentially high demand for staffing support, and deliver clear, actionable recommendations to Clipboard Healthâ€™s leadership team that could improve sales targeting, decision-making, and operational success.
